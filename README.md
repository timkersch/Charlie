# Charlie
A Spotify based music quiz application.

## About
The purpose of the application is to simplify the task of creating, distributing and playing music quizes.
The original project was carried out in April and March, 2016 as part of the course "DAT076 - Web Applications" at Chalmers University of Technology.

The project was forked from the original one in September, 2016 with the purpose of rebuilding the project using Node.js instead of a Java backend, improve the product and add new functionality.

## Overview
The application is a Spotify based music quiz which lets users create a quiz from or based on a playlist.
Friends can then join the quiz and everyone can play together. After starting the quiz, each user turns to their screen
and selects one of four artist choices for the questions.

## Technical design
The application is built with AngularJS as the frontend application and Node.js as the backend solution.

## Setup and run
To run this project follow the instructions below.
```
git clone https://github.com/timkersch/Charlie.git
```
Then in the Charlie directory install the dependencies with npm
```
npm install
```
Create a file for the environment variables
```
Charlie/.env
```
The structure of the file should be the following:
```
CLIENT_ID=123id123
CLIENT_SECRET=123secret123
CALLBACK=http://localhost:8080/callback.html

COOKIE_SECRET=321secret321

MONGO_URL=mongodb://localhost:27017/charlie
```
The first three entries are Spotify API credentials that can be created from Spotifys website.
```
https://developer.spotify.com/my-applications/#!/applications
```
The forth entry is the secret to sign the session cookie with.

The fifth entry is the url to your local mongodb server.

Then make sure you have a MongoDB server installed and fire it up from the command line using
```
mongod
```
Finally fire up the server locally and visit localhost
```
npm start
```
